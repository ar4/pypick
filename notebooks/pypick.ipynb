    "# PyPick: seismic event picking using Matplotlib and machine learning\n",
    "*by [Alan Richardson](mailto:alan@ausargeo.com) ([Ausar Geophysical](http://www.ausargeo.com))*\n",
    "\n",
    "Picking, either arrivals in data or horizons in migrated images, is a common task in seismic processing. I wanted to try doing it using Matplotlib so that I could pick data on remote servers using a Jupyter notebook and also easily have access to the picks in Python for further processing. It additionally seemed like a task that might be a fun potential application of machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result is rather slow and a bit fragile, but it seems to work moderately well. It is just a toy project at the moment, so I don't know whether it would work on realistically-sized datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Method\n",
    "\n",
    "### Picking with Matplotlib\n",
    "One really nice feature of Matplotlib is that it can use several different backends. These allow it to run in different situations, such as on different operating systems, and, notably, in web browsers using Jupyter notebooks. Writing a picking utility using Matplotlib thus means that it can run locally on a computer, and also on a remote server accessed via a web browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "A second feature of Matplotlib that is critical for this application is that it supports event triggers. Clicking on the plot can trigger an event that passes the location of the click to a function I have written. This is understandably difficult for Matplotlib to do across multiple backends, but it worked for me both locally (using the Qt4 backend) and in a Jupyter notebook, although it is much slower than I would like and is sometimes a bit temperamental. I initially considered using [`pyplot.ginput`](https://matplotlib.org/devdocs/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.ginput.html), but this wasn't supported by the Jupyter notebook backend. The [`mpl_connect`](https://matplotlib.org/users/event_handling.html) function did work, though, and supports both mouse clicks and button presses. To enable interactive plots in Jupyter notebooks, you need to use the `%matplotlib notebook` magic function, rather than the more common `%matplotlib inline` (which renders the plots as static PNG images).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Predicting picks using machine learning\n",
    "We don't want to have to pick the event in every frame of data. In the case of seismic data, we would like to be able to pick the event on a few gathers spread over the volume, and then have the computer predict the picks for the rest of the data. This is often accomplished with a combination of interpolation and peak/trough detection, but I decided to try applying machine learning tools to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "I split the task into two parts. The first consists of predicting the approximate location of a trace's pick. For this I use regression methods from [Scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/), such as [linear regression](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression.html) or [support vector machines](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.svm.SVR.html). I allow the user to specify which method to use, so the parameters can be chosen, or the regression method could even be wrapped in a [grid search](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV.html). This approximate pick is used to isolate a window of data that hopefully contains the true pick location, which is then passed to the second prediction step.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second part of the prediction uses a single layer convolutional neural network to identify the pick location within the window provided by the first part. It can also use a user supplied function instead. Using a neural network rather than peak/trough detection means that, if desired, you do not need to pick along a peak or trough. It also creates the possibility that the network could detect more complicated waveforms than simple peak or tough detection, potentially improving its ability to identify the correct event. For this neural network part, I use [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "To test the code, I will try to pick the first break in the [2D Alaska 31-81 dataset](http://wiki.seg.org/wiki/Alaska_2D_land_line_31-81). I used [Karl Schleicher's processing flow](http://s3.amazonaws.com/open.source.geoscience/open_data/alaska/alaska31-81.tar.gz) to remove auxiliary traces and add geometry to the dataset. I then used my [netcdf_segy](https://github.com/ar4/netcdf_segy) tool to convert the data to NetCDF format, which I load below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that I use the `%matplotlib notebook` magic function to specify that I want to use the interactive backend."

You can do this by holding down the 'd' key. Clicking and dragging while 'd' is pressed will create a rectangular selector that will delete all points within in. I have found that when doing this, I have to ensure that I am not in zoom or pan mode for it to work."

These will not necessarily be the same, although we would like them to be as similar as possible. The accuracy is affected by the estimators that are used and their parameters. One interesting way to choose estimator parameters would be using [ipywidgets](http://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/Using%20Interact.html) to create sliders to adjust the estimator parameters until you like the results. Another would be to use GridSearchCV, as I mentioned previously. I have decided to use the latter on both steps of the prediction."

    "To run travel time inversion with Tomo2D, a few files are required. The first of these, which I will call \"picks.txt\", contains the travel time picks. The format is described in the Tomo2D documentation. It mainly consists of providing the source and receiver coordinates, and the associated travel time. As the depth axis is assumed to point downward, I use the negative of the elevations as the depth of the sources and receivers. To ensure that they are in the earth, rather than being affected by the air velocity, I shift the elevations slightly by `srcrecdepth_km`.\n",

Since the same source will occur in many traces, and similarly for each receiver, I only use the first occurrence of each to avoid duplicates.

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "This picking tool is currently quite slow and fragile, but the convenience of being able to run it locally or remotely using a Jupyter notebook, and of having easy access to the results in Python, may compensate for this. Although it is only intended for demonstration, applying it to larger datasets may be possible. The main obstacle would probably be a shortage of memory. The prediction step, in particular, loads large parts of the dataset into memory. Running the prediction on batches of frames (`picks.predict(frame_ids)`) rather than on the whole dataset at once, might overcome that problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using machine learning for picking seems to work quite well, although I certainly think there is room for improvement. One feature that may be desirable is an enforcement of continuity. At the moment, there is no penalty for predicting picks with large jumps between neighbouring traces. Another current shortcoming is the restriction of only having one pick per trace. This is reasonable when picking arrivals in seismic data (such as the first break picking example above), but may be problematic for picking seismic images where a fault could cause the same layer to occur at two depths in the same depth trace.\n",
    "\n",
